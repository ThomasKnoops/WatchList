# WatchList - An Android App
This is a native Android app, made for my class Android Development @ Erasmus Hogeschool Brussels.

## Configuration
To run this project, you need to clone this repository onto your own system. Then you need to run this in Android Studio with an Emulator.
You also need to make an account on TMDB and ask for an API Key. This should take only 3 minutes. Then you need to fill your API-ReadAccesToken into the gradle.properties filed, behind "TMDB_API_KEY="
Now you are good to go!

## Languages
This app is English or Dutch. The language is set to the language of your phone. If your phone is set to Dutch, the app will be in Dutch. If your phone is set to English or a not supported language, the app will be in English.
